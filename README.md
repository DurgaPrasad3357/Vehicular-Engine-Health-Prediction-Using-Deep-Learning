# Vehicular-Engine-Health-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning
This project predicts vehicle engine health using a hybrid deep learning model (LSTM + Transformer). Users upload engine sensor data via a Flask web app, and the model detects potential faults. It enables early fault detection for predictive maintenance.  Technologies: Python, Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy.
